# Galaxy-Jam

Hello! You are likely here from the game's itch.io page. If not, the link is here: https://intothevoid701.itch.io/galaxy-jam
This is a game that I coded for the olcCodeJam 2021. The theme was future.

## KILLSTREAKS 

Every kill contributes to your killstreak. When you die, your killstreak resets. See how high you can get it. Simple enough?

## MOVEMENT

Arrow keys/A & D keys - Move you left and right 
Space bar/Z key - Shoot

Never. Stop. **Moving**. The aliens are clever, they only shoot when they know they can hit you. Try to dodge.

# Galaxy-Jam-

Hello! You are likely here from the game's itch.io page. If not, the link is here: https://intothevoid701.itch.io/galaxy-jam

This is a game that I coded for the olcCodeJam 2021. The theme was future.

Arrow keys/A & D keys - Move you left and right
Space bar/Z key - Shoot

Never. Stop. **Moving.**

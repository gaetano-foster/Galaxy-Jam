# Galaxy-Jam

I wrote the original version of this game in one night when I was 13 years old for the olcCodeJam 2021 competition. The theme was future. https://intothevoid701.itch.io/galaxy-jam
It has had some updates since then, such as meteors and updated graphics, but the core gameplay is the same.

## BOOMSTREAKS 

Every kill contributes to your boomstreak. When you die, your boomstreak resets. See how high you can get it. 
If you can time it right, hit a meteor to change its course. If it hits an alien ship, every alien on the screen explodes.

## MOVEMENT

Arrow keys/A & D keys - Move you left and right 
Space bar/Z key - Shoot
